        <h2>why you should get a maltese</h2>
        <p>Rocky, a one year old maltese is one of the if not the best maltese dogs in theee world.with his stupidity and cleverness all mixed into one, he is truley one in a million.
             for that reason lemme tell you why u should get one fluff just like him:
            He can be used as an emotional attacker in which he can judge all your outfits,force you to walk him everyday.
            critisize your own food and then beg you for your own food. number 2 he pooops everywhere if he is mad at anybody.buuuuuut on the bright side he is very loyal to an extent and he can speak not english but just a little bit.
            he understands upto 4 languages from english to kiswahili to kikuyu and also whatever languages dogs speak.he can imitate a baby which is good for cosplay when i am bored.
             since i have zero proof at this moment i can tell u for a fact he is extremly annoyed with my love and anannoyance towards him.
             but the thing is he cant because i am noo longer with him which is really hard for the both of us but i shall see him one way or another.
             for now enjoy photos that have a very similar resemblance to him

        in the following photo i will show you how judgy and cute he is. he may bully you for a slice of food or look at you with some sort of sadness
         which i think most people call'puppy eyes'

    <h3>  a photo of him now</h3>
    <p> this is one of the latest photos of him in where we can see he is
        very hairy and a bit fat</p>
        </div>
        <div style="background-color: blueviolet;">
            <img style="width: 400px; margin: 10px;"  src= "images\dwayne the rocky jr 6.png"alt="avatar" srcset="">
            <h3> how to handle him</h3>
            <p> were meant to know that he hates being carried in any way or form unless 
                like a baby (which means not on his back)
            </p>
        </div>
    <div style="background-color: chocolate;"> <img style=" width: 400px; margin: 10px;" src="images\dwanye the rocky jr 9.png" alt="">
        <h3> a reminder of the past</h3>
        <p> on his first day this is how he looked like but with a more boxed head 
            he was always an easy one to carry since you only needed one hand to do it. he had a square body with thick thighs and a nyash like no other. he's the thickest dog in town and I've ever seen!!! </p>
